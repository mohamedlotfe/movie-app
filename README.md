# movie-app

○ The application should be in a Github monorepo containing a web and an api
folder.
○ The api folder should contain a nodeJS application serving a list of movies
through the endpoint GET /movies. The list of movies can be hard coded
in the api application (no need to connect to a database).
○ The web folder should contain a React application created from the
Facebook create-react-app boilerplate and consuming the api application
to display the list of movies.

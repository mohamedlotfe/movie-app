<h1> Why this Project </h1>
</br>
<ul>
<liThe api folder should contain a nodeJS application serving a list of movies
through the endpoint GET /movies. </li>
<li>The web folder should contain a React application created from the
Facebook <strong> create-react-app </strong> boilerplate and consuming the api application
to display the list of movies. </li>
</ul>
</br>
